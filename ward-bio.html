                </h1>

                    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lester-Frank-Ward">Lester Frank Ward (1841-1913)</a>

                    ,a Reform Darwinist, is an early American sociologist who critiques the “unitary assumptions” of social 
                    Darwinism and laissez-faire individualism. (Hofstadter 68). Like Ambedkar for India, Ward advocates for a 
                    <span class="bannotate">planned society</span> and is among the first Americans to “interpret” European thought on state intervention 
                    (Hofstadter 81). 

                    Against Gilded Age's naturalization of inequality at the close of Reconstruction Era, Ward empircally and theoretically argued that 
                    poverty can and should be ameliorated
                    by systematic  <span class="bannotate">intervention</span> by the state. Whether through the philanthropy of settlement houses or through democratic 
                    processes, communities should direct the development of their societies by aligning the state's intersts with their own. 

                    Ward's most important book, Dynamic Sociology (1883), was the importance of education.  He believed in a Sociology that could direct and guide social and economic development and in its study produce such 
                    knowledge to establish universal and holistic educational systems that can regulate competition and secure equal opportunity and social cooperation. 
                   
                    Ward writes his <span class="bannotate">Gynaecocentric Theory</span> suggesting that the female sex is originally  <span class="bannotate">primary</span> and the male is 
                    secondary in the  <span class="bannotate">"organic scheme."</span> The current androcentric model is 
                    thus an artificial and (intended to be) permanent reordering of the natural scheme.



                    <i>Connection to Problem of the Rupee:</i> Ambedkar argues that the exchange rate is artificially manipulated to perpetually devalue the rupee 
                    against the sterling: as such, <i>Problem of the Rupee</i> participates in broader questions of (artificially distorted) exchange & 
                    exchange rates.
