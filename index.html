                Project research method: Ambedkar is often recognized as a radical anti-caste thinker, an active constitutional 
                lawyer, and the father of India's constitution. He indeed is all of this and more, but recognizing Ambedkar's 
                pedagogical formation as political economist is often overlooked, and his anti-caste thought is used as a way to 
                pin him down as a “colonial stooge.” We use Ambedkar's 1923 LSE thesis <i>Problem of the Rupee</i>, as a way to situate 
                Ambedkar as a political economist and at the same time to revitalize his anti-colonial thought. We then identify the 
                <i>Problem of the Rupee</i> (and Ambedkar's political economic thought) as a work that is situated at the nexus of 
                overlapping and diverse intellectual networks and modes of thinking—spheres inhabited by the colonial bureaucrat as the 
                political economist, by the economic feminist engaging with questions of surplus, and by the early-20th century US 
                university intellectual embedded in the question of the eminent domain.

                The project of annotation resembles the excavation of an artefact, wherein we uncover new and surprising 
                nformation and connections as we (re)read. These modes of presentation (static slides and interactive website) 
                were produced with the following questions in mind: Who gets to annotate? Who gets to read these texts? As public 
                pedagogues, we simultaneously engage in both knowledge dissemination and selection. How can we blur the lines separating the “public” and the “pedagogue,” and make an act as personal, intimate, and solitary as close-reading and annotation a one that is inherently shared, collective, and interactive?
                We do this by offering a bi-dimensional, multimodal, and immersive reading and annotational experience. 
                We have a website interface that gamifies, simplifies, and makes interactive the process of reading through and annotating a 
                dense treatise like PoR. We also have this slide deck which is a static, more detailed version of our annotations, that a 
                more interested reader can go through.

                    and it claims that Seligman and Columbia appear to have a known interest in Cannan's work. The fact that Seligman is 
                    taking interest in Cannan's work in 1913—when Ambedkar is studying at CU and certainly thinking about his eventual 
                    thesis—shows that through Seligman, Ambedkar seems to have been begun engaging with the economists he takes issue with eventually in PoR.

                <p>
                    "The Economic Outlook" is a compilation of essays that were initially written to create a general "manual" on Political Economy that also engaged with 
                    concepts of socialism. Importantly, there are three chapters titled "The practical utility of economic science," that is immediately followed by "colonial preference," 
                    and then eventually, 
                    "the economic ideal and its application to countries or nations." This is the book referenced in the letter.

                    "The present Indian system has close affinities with other currency systems in some of the great 
                    European countries and elsewhere. To get an idea as to what these affinities are, or rather were, 
                    we must look into Chapter II of Mr. Keynes's interesting treatise on <span class="annotate">Indian Currency and Finance.</span>
                    In that treatise of his, Mr. Keynes has attempted to show that there is a 
                    <span class="annotate">fundamental likeness</span>
                    between
                    the operations of the <span class="annotate">Indian currency system</span> and the operations as they used to be of the central banks 
                    of some of the important countries of <span class="annotate">Europe.</span> He found that it used to be the practice of these banks

                    selling of such foreign bills and the selling of reverse councils by the Government of India he observed a closefundamental likeness, inasmuch as both involved. But, as Prof. Kemmerer points out, it is difficult to see what likeness there is between the Government of 
                    India selling reverse councils and the European banks holding foreign bills. 
                    <span class="annotate">Far from being alike,</span>
                    the two practices must be regarded as the opposite of each other.[...] Under the 
                     practice of holding foreign bills to protect the money market, the central bank sells its foreign bills,

                    securing gold for importation or preventing its 
                     exportation. In the former case, the sale of drafts takes the place of an exportation of gold, and the 
                     resulting withdrawal of local money from circulation is in essentials an exportation ; in the latter case 
                     the sale of the drafts abroad is part of a process for securing gold for importation, or for preventing its 
                     exportation.The Indian currency system therefore bears no analogy to the European currency systems, as Mr. Keynes would 
                    have us believe. But if a parallel is needed, then the true parallel to the Indian system of currency is 
                    that system which prevailed in England during the Bank Suspension period (1797-1821)." - Ambedkar, <i>Problem of the Rupee</i> 172-3.

                    The labor of women in the house, certainly, enables men to

                        Establishing the proprietary family at an age when the industry was primitive and domestic; and thereafter 
                        confining the woman solely to the domestic area, he thereby confined her to primitive industry. The domestic industries, 
                        in the hands of women, constitute a survival of our remotest past. Such work was "woman's work" as was all the work then known; 
                        such work is still considered woman's work because they have been prevented from doing any other.
                        The term "domestic industry" does not define a certain kind of labor, but a certain <span class="bannotate">grade of labor."</span>

                    Florence Kelley argues that the rise of the Socialist movement is 'so sudden' that it has an 'urgent' 
                    'need of <span class="bannotate">suitable</span>  literature,'indicating the <span class="bannotate">urgency</span> of translation work. She calls 
                    the American political machine corrupt with its lack of 'literature,' 'unenlightened leaders,' and 
                    'capitalist press.' She then describes to Engels the 'organizing' movement of American trusts and 
                    determines the American bourgeois as without 'want of <span class="bannotate">class consciousness.</span>' 
                    According to her, this 'arouses further the class consciousness of the workers' although
                     they remain unenlightened insofar as the 'best of our literature' is not available to the working 
                     lass of America. Kelley laments the absence of 'scientific literature' in America, alluding  to her

                <p>
                    Engels lends considerable influence to  Kelley and her intellectual creed/methodology. Engels'
                     description of England's advanced industrial capacity (taking the case of the industrial hubs Liverpool and Manchester),
                      expansive proletariat, and undercurrent of class conflict along the axis of labor and wage strike a deep chord in Kelley's 
                      understanding of and ultimately contributions to American Socialism. In almost all her future social and economic work, 
                      Kelley will emulate the methodology adopted by Engels in Condition, of empirical data collection & organization as 
                      evidence for capitalism's disastrous excesses.

                    America (labor legislation, unionization, women's emancipation). Kelley extensively follows Socialist periodicals in America and Europe and criticizes the deliberate "dilutions" of Socialist thought by university intellectuals 
                    and the 

                    <span class="bannotate">perversions</span> 
                    
                    of English translation of German works, where 'blind continue to lead the blind.' She believes such translations are
                    dishonest and further cripple America's Socialist movement.

                </h1>
                <p>
                    
                    Thusfar, economic feminists have primarily engaged with questions of women, children, and the 
                    unequal valuation of their labor as it manifests in <span class="bannotate">wage slavery</span>
                     and abysmal working conditions.
                    We have seen how Ambedkar enters these conversations by virtue of a shared lexicon of ideas, 
                    terms, and theories. Although not an explicitly distinctive feature of <i>Problem of the Rupee</i>, 
                    a large corpus of Ambedkar's work dedicates itself to <span class="bannotate">caste</span> as a complex and trans-acting form of 
                    social stratification. Given the intellectual and professional focus of the economic feminists in 
                    America, how does <span class="bannotate">racial stratification,</span> discussed foremostly between Black and white people, figure 
                    in the work of the Ambedkar's “counterparts?” Do they similarly grapple with questions of social 
                    stratification beyond and including gender? Where do their practices diverge from Ambedkar's? How does this reveal the limits or 
                    lack thereof in their positionalities?

                    Mary White Ovington helps establish the Greenpoint Settlement House in NY, where she is 
                    deeply involved with civil rights and women's suffrage. She joins the Socialist Party in 1905.

                    In 1909, Ovington joins with W.E.B du Bois, Ida B. Wells, John Dewey, Jane Addams, and 
                    Florence Kelley to form the <span class="bannotate">NAACP</span> and serves as its first executive secretary. 

                    In 1911, she publishes <i>Half a Man: The Status of the Negro in New York City</i> and describes 
                    the status of the “Negro” in New York City by examining the <span class="bannotate">economic and social</span> conditions, 
                    engaging with anthropological and ethnographic theories/methodologies to counter the 
                    prejudice that Black Americans were “inferior” and underscore the “burden” 
                    of racial segregation on Black communities. 

                    In <span class="bannotate">"The Colored Woman as Breadwinner,"</span> Ovington specifically differentiates the socio-economic 
                    status of the “Negro laboring woman” from the “white laboring woman,” due to the “different 
                    occupational opporutnities” in “white and colored neighborhoods,” thus deeply interrogating the 
                    1. intersections of labor, race, and sex and 2. the futile gains of (white) women's

                    the Negro question." He disagrees with Kelley that the South cannot be "put in the same category as 
                    Russia." He then draws a multiple contrasting points between Southern lynchings and

                    that "pedagogy" or "statesmanship" is the solution. He then goes on to write that Black folk must

                    Daisly L. Bishop writes to Kelley asking for any work that Kelley may have for her. 
                    She writes admiringly of Kelley's work for Black folk in the United States. Bishop says 
                    that although she works in politics for "white Republicans," she and other Black folk are 
                    misused as political "tools" for political organizing efforts and fundraising but are left 
                    abandoned post-election season. She writes that she is "sick" of this, and asks Kelley for

                    In an unrelated letter to social worker Lavinia Dock, Kelley takes issue with the Woman's Party 
                    definition of gender equaltiy, which argues that equality of rights is to give women of each group 
                    (professional, business, Negro, Japanese) the rights of the men of their corresponding group 
                    (she emphasizes that this definition sounds like “caste, not equality”). This indicates that Kelley was 
                    likely (perhaps due to her relationship with du Bois and the caste school of race relations) engaging with texts
                    and theories investigating the relationships between race and caste as forms/types of inequality.

                <p>
                    An early draft of Kelley's essay “The Negro Children as Future Workers” (1914). 
                    Kelley writes that the future of “colored children” and the “future product of their labor” 
                    are of dire concern for the “whole republic.” Kelley is thinking about the intersections of race 
                    in the labor question, and the “responsibility” of white social workers to Black communities.

                    Kelley notes only in the marginalia of this draft that racial inequality is an “artificial mechanism” 
                    of segregation that enhances the “power of whiteness.”

            Economic feminists such as Kelley, Gilman, Ovington, and Cooper; Socialists like Engels, Gronlund,

                    Seligman writes to David Miller Barbour 
                    (one of the colonial bureaucratic political economists with whom Ambedkar is in contention) in 1914: 
                    “there has been a lot of discussion in the United States, not indeed of the precise question that you 
                    raise, but of an analogous question. The problem with us is not govt disposing of any of its properties 
                    but the reverse one, of the govt buying up private enterprise.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Seligman seems to insinuate that Barbour writes to him about the question of the “valuation” of 
                    property that the government has disposed. Assessing this—knowing that Barbour was a colonial 
                    bureaucrat in India who was deeply involved in the currency question—it would be an educated guess 
                    to say that Barbour was referring to the question of valuing demonetized Indian currency.
                    But, a further stretch of our historical imagination—considering that Seligman is talking about the way 
                    the colonial Indian govt is looking to dispose (demonetize) while the US govt is analogously buying up
                     private enterprises—makes one wonder if the reason why Seligman sees an analogy of valuation is because
                      of a common line of connection: the railway question.

                    result of the fall in its value due to the closure. An agitation was set up by interested parties to compel the 
                    Government to make good the loss. Ultimately, the Government was prevailed upon by Sir James Mackay (now Lord Inchcape), 
                    the very man who forced Government to close the Mints, to take the silver from the banks. The Government 
                    proposed to the Secretary of State that they be allowed to sell the silver even at a loss rather than coin and
                     add to the already redundant volume of currency. The Secretary of State having refused, the silver was coined 
                     and added to the currency. The stoppage of Council Bills in 1893-94 had temporarily accumulated a large number of 
                     rupees in their Treasuries, a transaction which practically amounted to a contraction of currency. 
                     But the Government later decided to 
                    spend them on railway construction—a policy tantamount to an addition to currency.” (p. 213)

                    “During the first period of the Mint closure, 1893-98, it will be recalled how a large number of 
                    rupees had accumulated in the hands of the Government, and in the interest of raising the value of the 
                    rupee they should have been locked away. Instead the Government of India released that money in 
                    circulation in extending railways and other public works, as though the spending of rupees by itself 
                    produced an effect different to what would have been produced had they been spent by the public. 
                    [This is an example of] irresponsible conduct.” (p. 229)
