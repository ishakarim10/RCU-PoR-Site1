                <h1 class="animated-text"> B.R. Ambedkar: Political Economist, Radical Social Reformer, Sociologist
                </h1>
                <p>
                    
                    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bhimrao-Ramji-Ambedkar">B.R. Ambedkar (1891-1956)</a>
                    
                    was a visionary Indian jurist, social reformer, and the chief architect of the Indian Constitution. Educated at the University of 
                    Bombay, Ambedkar later pursued advanced studies at Columbia University, where he earned a doctorate in economics. 
                    At Columbia, he was profoundly influenced by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Dewey">John Dewey</a>, a 
                    renowned philosopher and education reformer, who became his mentor and had a lasting impact on his intellectual development.

                    Furthering his academic pursuits, Ambedkar studied at the London School of Economics, earning another doctorate in 
                    economics. His multifaceted contributions spanned law, economics, and social justice, culminating in his pivotal role as the 
                    chairman of the drafting committee for the Indian Constitution. A prolific thinker and correspondent, Ambedkar was very well connected internationally and closely maintained these relationships.
                    
                    Ambedkar's seminal works, including "Castes in India," "Annihilation of Caste," and "Buddha or Karl Marx," critiqued the entrenched caste system in India, 
                    advocating for its abolition to achieve social justice and equality especially in a newly independent India. 
                    His advocacy for the rights of the Dalits and marginalized communities fundementally shaped the discourse on social 
                    reform in India and continues to do so today. Ambedkar's legacy endures as a international beacon of social 
                    equality and justice, influencing movements globally and inspiring ongoing struggles for human rights. At the close of his life, 
                    Ambedkar remained a radical as he publicly renounced Hinduism and converted to Buddhism.
