                </h1>
                <p>
                    
                    A Danish-American lawyer, Gronlund joined the primarily German-American Socialist Labor Party, 
                    where he openly advocated for a German style trade-union based form of International Socialism. 
                    He writes Socialist pamphlets in English  to popular interest in a time where Marx's and Engels' works
                    are not yet translated from German.

                    With Marx and Engels yet to be translated into English, 
                    <span class="bannotate">Cooperative Commonwealth</span> is sensational in America but soon 
                    disappears when English language translations such as Florence Kelley's are published.

                    Like Ambedkar who characterizes money as “necessary to facilitate trade,” Gronlund says that  
                    “money brings [people] together; is, as it is termed, a medium of exchange between them.” 
                    Gronlund relies on Marx's <span class="bannotate">labor theory of value</span> to argue that the overproduction of Capital has an 
                    inverse relationship to wages earned: essentially, laborers can never purchase what they produce. 
                    Considering Ambedkar's monetary theory of expropriation of Indian raw materials by the British, 
                    how does Ambedkar use Socialist and particularly Marxist ideas to critique colonial monetary mismanagement?
