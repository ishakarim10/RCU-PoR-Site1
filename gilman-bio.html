                    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charlotte-Perkins-Gilman"> Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860-1935)</a>
                    
                    was a pioneering American writer, lecturer, and advocate for women's rights, best known for her influential works in the realms of feminism and economics during the Progressive Era. Raised in a tumultuous household, Gilman's early life experiences deeply influenced her later activism. Despite limited formal education, she became a self-taught scholar and prolific writer.

                    Gilman's groundbreaking essay, "The Yellow Wallpaper," highlighted the oppressive nature of women's domestic roles and sparked conversations about mental health and gender inequality. In her landmark book, "Women and Economics," she dissected the economic subjugation of women and argued for their financial independence and equality in the workforce.
                    
                    During the Progressive Era, Gilman's ideas gained traction, impacting social and political discourse. She actively engaged in public speaking, championing feminist causes, and advocating for societal reforms. Her work influenced prominent figures of the time, including Theodore Roosevelt and Jane Addams. Gilman's unwavering commitment to dismantling gender norms and economic disparities left an enduring mark on the Progressive Era, contributing to the ongoing struggle for women's rights and societal transformation.
