                </h1>
                <p>
                    
                    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-T-Ely">Richard T. Ely (1885-1943)</a>
                    
                    is an American German-trained economist who retooled German Socialism to rethink questions of the 
                    <span class="bannotate">cooperative state:</span>
                     he was “deep into studies of working-class socialist and labor movements” and formed the American 
                     Economic Association with Seligman and other German university economics students, establishing the 
                     German school as the theoretical framework for American Socialism. (Rodgers 99) 


                     Subscribing to the vogue of eugenics, Ely was however opposed the unchecked competition of laissez-faire 
                     economics advocated by the Social Darwinists. He primarily believed the German historical school could 
                     best answer questions of <span class="bannotate">"evolution"</span> and <span class="bannotate">"relativity"</span> 
                     among peoples and markets (Hofstadter 147). Ely's work 
                     demonstrates the importance of the German school of Socialism on the nascent American Socialist organization.

                     Ely mentors Florence Kelley at “home,” who writes to him often to discuss sharing new Socialist work with 
                     his university network. Here, she disagrees with him that Socialism has no relation “concerning the family as a social 
                     institution,” arguing that if “the means of production” belong to the community, a woman is economically independent, 
                     thus “making love free.”
