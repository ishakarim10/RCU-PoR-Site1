                <p>
                    
                    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Friedrich-Engels">Frederick Engels (1820-95)</a>
                    
                     is a prominent 20th century German Socialist intellectual and a close 
                    collaborator with Engels. Engels meets Florence Kelley when she arrives for graduate studies at the 
                    University of ZÃ¼rich and immerses herself in Socialist theory and politics.

                    Engels agrees to Kelley's English translation of Condition and writes a preface addressed particularly to the 
                    American public and working class. Kelley's translation popularizes Socialist literature and energizes the 
                    domestic American movement.

                    Like Seligman for Ambedkar, Engels seems to function as a mentor for Kelley, who in future social work will 
                    adopt his form in Condition to present the expropriation & exploitation of women's and child labor using 
                    aggregated statistical data.
