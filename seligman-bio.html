                    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edwin-Robert-Anderson-Seligman"> Edwin R.A. Seligman (1861-1939)</a>
                    
                    is 
                    was a distinguished American economist, notable for his significant contributions during his tenure at Columbia University. As a professor, he played a pivotal role in shaping economic thought and policy. Seligman's most enduring legacy lies in his advocacy for the graduated income tax, a concept he championed and influenced in the United States. His book, "The Income Tax: A Study of the History, Theory, and 
                    Practice of Income Taxation at Home and Abroad," became a seminal work on the subject.

                    Beyond his academic pursuits, Seligman's global influence extended to his association with B.R. Ambedkar, 
                    a brilliant student at Columbia. Ambedkar, who later became a key architect of India's constitution, was 
                    profoundly influenced by Seligman's ideas on social justice and economic principles. Their relationship 
                    reflected Seligman's impact not only within academic circles but also on the international stage, 
                    contributing to transformative ideas that influenced economic and social policies.
